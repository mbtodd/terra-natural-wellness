				<h1>About</h1>
				<p>
					I'm a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) 200. I completed my training at the Inner Power Yoga Studio in Sterling,
					Virginia with Ursula Cox in 2017. I was trained by wonderful teachers and mentors who graciously shared their
					wisdom and practice; as a result, I will forever be the student of the practice. Yoga has been part of my life
					for 7 years, helping me to find inner strength, teaching me to be present and mindful both on the mat and
					throughout my life. My journey as a yogi began after recovering from childbirth. I went back to the gym with
					the intention of strengthening my core and losing weight. I landed in a yoga class and immediately realized I
					had arrived where I belong.
					<br />
					In my studio I teach 75-minute power vinyasa classes, focusing on breath and alignment. My classes include a
					community of students ranging from young adulthood to seniors.
					<br />
					As a teacher I focus on the whole person, meeting students where they are in their journey through wellness,
					as beginners or advanced yogis. As a community we celebrate small accomplishments, honoring and living the
					“Om” to create harmony and unity to support each other through our practice. As a yoga teacher, I love to see
					my students thrive and feel complete. I teach to connect the body with the mind and the breath, providing a
					calming effect, positioning each student to use the strength of their body to improve their balance in yoga
					and in life.
