				<h3>About</h3>
				<div className="hella-text">
					<p>
						I'm a Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT) 200. I completed my training at the Inner Power Yoga Studio in Sterling,
						Virginia with Ursula Cox in 2017. I was trained by wonderful teachers and mentors who graciously shared
						their wisdom and practice; as a result, I will forever be the student of the practice. Yoga has been part of
						my life for 7 years, helping me to find inner strength, teaching me to be present and mindful both on the
						mat and throughout my life. My journey as a yogi began after recovering from childbirth. I went back to the
						gym with the intention of strengthening my core and losing weight. I landed in a yoga class and immediately
						realized I had arrived where I belong.
						<br />
						In my studio I teach 75-minute power vinyasa classes, focusing on breath and alignment. My classes include a
						community of students ranging from young adulthood to seniors.
						<br />
						As a teacher I focus on the whole person, meeting students where they are in their journey through wellness,
						as beginners or advanced yogis. As a community we celebrate small accomplishments, honoring and living the
						“Om” to create harmony and unity to support each other through our practice. As a yoga teacher, I love to
						see my students thrive and feel complete. I teach to connect the body with the mind and the breath,
						providing a calming effect, positioning each student to use the strength of their body to improve their
						balance in yoga and in life.

					<h6>Testimonials:</h6>

					<p>
						Hella, Your class is more of a shared practice with you as our mentor than a group of people who work out
						together. Many of my other yoga teachers and classes rush through the poses-focusing on the physical side of
						yoga. My practice with you is more than that. You understand where I am today and help me there while
						showing me where I am trying to go. There is no pressure to move faster than I am ready for but you give a
						nudge if I become complacent in a pose. I feel you are more of a mentor than a teacher.
					</p>

					<p>
						Since taking yoga classes with Hella, I have learned how to manage stress, not only in class but through all
						areas of my life. As a working-mother of three, I truly feel like this is something for me that makes me a
						better person for my family and my colleagues. The bonus is what it’s done for my physique; I’ve shaped and
						toned areas that I thought were a lost cause!
